Minakov & Yarushina (2021) Elastoplastic Source Model 
for Microseismicity and Acoustic Emission, GJI, doi: 10.1093/gji/ggab207. 
The paper presents a mathematical model connecting the components of the seismic moment 
tensor with the plastic failure process. 
The model highlights theoretical links between stress state, 
geomechanical parameters, and conventional representations of the moment tensor
such as Hudson source type parameters.
